I am a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich working in the Learning & Adaptive Systems group of the Institute for Machine Learning advised by Prof. Andreas Krause. My research focuses on ensuring the safety of unknown systems through a combination of techniques from model-based control and supervised machine learning. My goal is to develop theoretically rigorous and computationally efficient methods, whose effectiveness is demonstrated in experiments with robots such as manipulators and underwater vehicles. 

Before Joining ETH Zurich in October 2023, I obtained a PhD, Master's, and Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, in 2023, 2018, and 2015, respectively. During my time as a PhD student, I worked under the supervision of Prof. Sandra Hirche on learning-based control funded by an ERC grant and a scholarship of the German Academic Scholarship Foundation. In 2016, I spent a semester abroad at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

**Student Supervision** I am open to supervising ambitious and talented Master’s and Bachelor’s students for their thesis. If you want to work with me, please send me an email describing your area of interest. Please also attach your CV and up-to-date transcripts.
